### NextJs 15 Starter with ShadCN, TailwindCSS, Prettier Plugin for TailwindCSS, and JavaScript.

#### Why did I choose these?

- ShadCN: An amazing component library: [https://ui.shadcn.com](https://ui.shadcn.com)
- Prettier Plugin for TailwindCSS sorts classes according to an order agreed upon at Tailwind Labs: [https://github.com/tailwindlabs/prettier-plugin-tailwindcss](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/prettier-plugin-tailwindcss)
- JavaScript, because I don't know TypeScript.
- The default font is set to Geist Sans in `globals.css` - the current default font in NextJs.

> This example uses `pnpm` as the package manager. If you are using a different package manager, first delete the `pnpm-lock.yaml` file before installing node_modules, otherwise it will cause a conflict in your project.
